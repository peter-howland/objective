This is a React.js resume application, and will eventually be deployed to my website and be used as a primary source of networking and a showcase of my development abilities, specifically with React.

It includes a dynamic version of my resume, which uses json data (eventually a database) to populate the resume, and automatically calculates the amount of time I've used each of my key skills, based on the time I spent at the jobs they are associated with.
